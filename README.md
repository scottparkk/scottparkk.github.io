# Scott Park Portfolio

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Tailwind CSS. The project is intentionally small and serves as a simple showcase of my work.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer
- npm (comes with Node)

## Setup

Install dependencies and start the local development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:4321` by default.

## Building

Create an optimized production build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated files are written to the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

After running the build command, deploy the contents of `dist/` to your preferred static hosting platform (for example GitHub Pages, Vercel or Netlify).
