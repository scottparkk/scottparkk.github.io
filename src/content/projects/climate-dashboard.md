## Project Overview

This interactive dashboard transforms complex climate datasets into compelling visual narratives. The project focuses on making environmental data accessible through thoughtful design and smooth interactions.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Data Integration**: Live feeds from climate APIs
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth D3.js animations between different data views
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices
- **Accessibility First**: Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels

### Design Process

The visual design emphasizes clarity and emotional connection to the data. Color choices reflect the urgency of climate change while maintaining accessibility standards.

### Technical Highlights

- Custom D3.js visualizations for time series data
- SVG-based charts with CSS animations for enhanced performance
- Modular JavaScript architecture for maintainability
- Optimized for 60fps animations on mobile devices

This project demonstrates how technical implementation can serve storytelling, making complex data both beautiful and meaningful.
