## Overview
 Inspired by the popular ‘Tamogotchi’, Todogotchi is a MacOS app that gamifies a simple to-do list into a rewarding experience for users. Users of the application are tasked with taking care of a virtual pet– doing so requires a user to complete items on their to-do list.
I specifically led Frontend Development for this project and was the UI/UX designer as well.


## Image Guide
1. Upon launching the app, the user is greeted with a login page.If the user has an account then they can login to access their stored information. Otherwise, a user can choose to register a new account.

2. Upon first login, you'll select your Todogotchi from three eggs. Use the "Rotate Pet" button to browse options, then name your chosen egg in the input box and double-click "Choose Pet" to confirm. Note: Your selection is final and cannot be changed.

3. The main page of the application will display a user's dynamically changing pet information like it's level, experience, and evolutionary form. Additionally, periodic motivational messages appear on the screen, and a user can click on the pet to display a jump animation. The current weather and time are displayed too.

4. Accessing a user's to-do list through the main page will display a user's folders. A user can organize notes by a folder hierarchy for better organization.

5. Accessing a folder will display a user's notes. Note pages can contain 'tasks' which are the specific to-do list items. Users can mark off tasks in order to gain EXP that will level their pet.

6. A user can additionally edit a task's name, due date, and category. A due date will create a progress bar that displays the time left till a task is due. Changing the priority of a task, normally done for more drawn out or difficult tasks, will contribute more EXP to a user's pet.
